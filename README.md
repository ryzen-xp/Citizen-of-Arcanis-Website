# 🚀 Internal Commit and Branch Guide | Citizen of Arcanis Marketplace  
This guide is designed for **our team**. The goal is to keep the codebase clear and organized, making collaboration easier and ensuring we can understand changes in the future.  

---  

## 🛠️ The Basics (Important)  
- **Branch names and commit messages in lowercase**: Keeps things uniform and organized.  
- **Short and clear commit messages**: If a commit needs too much explanation, it might need to be split.  
- **Max 72 characters for the title**: If you need more detail, use the extended description.  
- **One commit, one purpose**: Group similar changes into a single commit. If you worked on different things, create multiple commits.  

---  

## 🌳 Branch Naming: Clear and Consistent  
Use the following structure when naming branches so everyone understands the purpose:  

**Format:**  
`<prefix>/<short-description>` 

**Main Prefixes:**  
- **feat/** – New features.  
- **fix/** – Bug fixes.  
- **remove/** – Deleting files or features.  
- **docs/** – Documentation updates.  
- **style/** – Visual or formatting changes (no logic adjustments).  
- **refactor/** – Code restructuring without changing functionality.  
- **perf/** – Performance improvements.  
- **test/** – Adding or updating tests.  
- **build/** – Changes to the build system or dependencies.  
- **ci/** – Continuous integration changes.  
- **chore/** – Maintenance and routine tasks.

## Example Branch Names  
- `feat/user-authentication`  
- `fix/cart-error`  
- `docs/api-endpoints`  
- `style/navbar-icons`

## ✍️ Writing Effective Commits  
**Commit Format:**  
`<type>: <what you did>`  

**Main Types:**  
- **feat** – New feature.  
- **fix** – Bug fix.  
- **docs** – Documentation update.  
- **style** – Formatting or appearance changes.  
- **refactor** – Code restructuring without functional changes.  
- **perf** – Performance optimizations.  
- **test** – Add or update tests.  
- **build** – Dependency or build tool updates.  
- **ci** – CI/CD changes.  
- **chore** – Maintenance tasks.
- **update** – Maintenance  without functional changes (no code).

## Key Commit Rules  
- **Be clear and direct**: Write commits that explain exactly what was done.  
- **Use present tense**: *"add email validation"* instead of *"added email validation"*.  
- **Avoid confusing or temporary commits**: If it's not ready, keep it in your local branch or create a specific branch for it.

## Example Commit Messages  
- `feat: implement product search`  
- `fix: resolve payment form validation`  
- `docs: update API sections`  
- `style: adjust margins on header`

## Why This Matters  
A clean commit history makes code reviews, collaboration, and troubleshooting faster and more efficient. Having a standard ensures the whole team moves in the same direction, saving time and preventing miscommunication.
